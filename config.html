            If the indicator light on your earphones turns on but doesn't flash, your earphones have already been set up with a

            If you have an iPhone with iOS 10 or later, follow these steps. When you set up your earphones in this way, they also
            set up automatically with any of your other supported devices that are signed in to iCloud and using iOS 10 or later,
            macOS Sierra or later, or watchOS 3 or later.

           <li style="color: #818181;">Press the power button on your earphones for 1 second.</li>
